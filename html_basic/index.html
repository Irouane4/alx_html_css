    <h3>Getting started with HTML</h3>
    <p>Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started â€” we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p>

    <h3>What's in the head? Metadata in HTML</h3>
    <p>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page 'Title', links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).</p>

    <h3>HTML text fundamentals</h3>
    <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</p>

    <h3>Advanced text formatting</h3>
    <p>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</p>
