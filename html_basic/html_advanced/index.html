        <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

            <h3>How can I get in touch with ALX Africa to answer the questions I have?</h3>
            <p>Please ask LEA our Learning Experience Assistant for more information and answers to any additional questions.</p>

            <h3>What is ALX?</h3>
            <p>ALX offers job-ready training in the tech fields employers need most. ALX, in partnership with The ROOM, is brought to you by the organisation that leads African Leadership Academy, African Leadership University, and Anzisha Prize Foundation.</p>

            <h3>What is your selection process like?</h3>
            <p>The ALX Selection Process is a two-step online process. First applicants will be required to complete a registration form which will take a few minutes to complete. Once this has been submitted, applicants will be directed to our online application platform. The application will take approximately 90 mins to complete and consists of three sections; including an English proficiency test. Applicants will also receive access to the online application via email. Your link to the application is personal and therefore cannot be shared.</p>

            <h3>Am I able to go to the Hubs?</h3>
            <p>Attending the in-person hubs is a benefit of the ALX learning experience. The in-person co-working spaces are designed to provide accountability, peer support, and the opportunity for face-to-face interaction and networking. This is intended to boost productivity and help individuals achieve their goals.</p>
